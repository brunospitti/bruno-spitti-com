hello: >-
  I'm Bruno Spitti, a Front-end developer who loves his job.

  I am an Italian citizen, which entitles me to work full-time across Europe,
  was born in São Paulo, Brazil and I’ve been living in Dublin since March,
  2017.


  In 2016 I’ve got my major in Digital Design at one of the greatest
  Universities in Brazil, Anhembi Morumbi.


  I love building websites from scratch as well as improving an existing one. I
  believe that the analysis of data extracted from the website is crucial to
  make more assertive designs and experiences to the user.

  I am a big believer that a software engineer has to always be in touch with
  the newest technologies and best practices.


  I’ve separated below some projects I’ve worked on my spare time as a way of
  keep learning new things. All of them with a live demo link and a brief
  section of what I’ve learned while developing it.
