hello: >-
  I’m Bruno Spitti, an Italian Front-end developer with a passion for developing
  with React, Redux, Javascript, HTML and CSS/SCSS


  In 2016 I graduated with a major in Digital Design in one of the greatest
  Universities in Brazil, Anhembi Morumbi.


  I love building and improving websites, working on features and scalable
  components as well as working on projects with a team of developers and I am
  at home when I can combine creativity with programming. I believe that the
  analysis of data extracted from the website is crucial to make more assertive
  designs and experiences to the user.
projects: >-
  I’ve always strived to work with the newest technologies and best practices
  throughout my career. My main focus has been with React, Redux, Javascript,
  HTML and CSS/SCSS.


  I’ve added some of my recent projects below. Each project has a live demo link
  and a brief section of what I’ve learned while developing it.
