  One of my graduation groupâ€™s projects, based on data visualization regarding
  the residential water usage. It has two parts, a prototype of water flow meter
  which sends, via Wi-Fi, the property water consumption data to a Android App
  built, as a prototype, using Phonegap. The project including research, subject
  decision, development and presentation took six five months.
